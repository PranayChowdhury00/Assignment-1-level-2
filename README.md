## Explain the difference between `any`, `unknown`, and `never` types in TypeScript

**Answer :-**

- **`any`:**  
  The `any` type in TypeScript is used when you don't know the exact value a user might provide. However, using `any` sacrifices TypeScript's type safety, making it similar to JavaScript,  
  where types aren't enforced. In short, there's little difference between using TypeScript with `any` and plain JavaScript.

- **`unknown`:**  
  The `unknown` type in TypeScript is a safer alternative to `any`. It represents a value that could be anything, but unlike `any`, you must narrow its type before performing operations.  
  This preserves TypeScript's type safety, preventing runtime errors by ensuring you handle the value's type explicitly.

- **`never`:**  
  Using `never` in TypeScript helps keep your code safe by catching mistakes like unreachable code or making sure you've handled every possible case in a type union. It's a great tool for writing  
  solid, reliable TypeScript code.

##  How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?

**Answer :-**

TypeScript makes your code better and keeps projects easier to handle. It adds types to JavaScript, so you catch mistakes early—like using a number instead of a string—before the code runs. That saves you  
from headaches later. Types also make your code easier to read, so you or your teammates can quickly figure out what’s going on.

For big projects, TypeScript is awesome. It helps everyone on the team avoid messing up each other’s code. Your editor can autocomplete stuff and spot errors as you type, which makes coding faster and less  
error-prone. When you need to update or tweak old code, TypeScript guides you to do it without breaking things. It’s like having a trusty sidekick that keeps your code tidy and your project smooth, even as it gets bigger.
